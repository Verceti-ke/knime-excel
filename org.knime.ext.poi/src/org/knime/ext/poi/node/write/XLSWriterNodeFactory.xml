		<intro>
 		This node writes out the datatable coming through its input port
 		into a spreadsheet of a workbook. The files can be read then with 
 		other applications like Microsoft Excel, for example.
 		The maximum number of columns held by a spreadsheet is 256 (all 
 		additional columns in the datatable are truncated). If the input 
 		datatable has more than 65536 rows it is split into multiple 
 		spreadsheets (all stored in the created workbook).
 		</intro>
