	<name>Excel Sheet Appender (XLS)</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Saves a data table into a spreadsheet.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node writes the input data table into a spreadsheet and appends it to an existing workbook.
            If no workbook is present a new one will be created. The files can
            be read then with other applications like Microsoft Excel, for
			example. The writer supports both the old 'xls' format as well as 'xlsx', whereby the same limitations
			apply as described in the documentation to the Excel Writer node (max 65536x256 for 'xls'). <br />
         Note that if the destination location is a remote URL not all options are available because in general it's
         not possible to determine whether the remote location exists. In this case it will always be overwritten.
         <br/>
         When no extension is specified, it will be treated as an xlsx file. This node can append data to macro-enabled
         workbooks (.xlsm), however, new workbooks cannot be created this way.
		</intro>
		<option name="Output location">
			Enter a valid file name or URL. You can also choose a previously
			selected location from the drop-down list, or select a file from
			the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
		</option>
        <option name="Abort if file does not exist">
            Abort the execution if the XLS/XLSX file does not exist. If this option
            is not selected a new file will be created.
        </option>
        <option name="Abort if sheet already exists">
            If a sheet with the same name does already exist, then the execution
            will fail. If this option is not selected the old sheet will be
            replaced by the new one.
        </option>
        <option name="Open file after execution">
            Opens the file after it has been successfully written. The file will
            be opened in the default application of the system. This might not
            be supported by every system.
        </option>
        <option name="Sheet name">
            Name of the sheet that will be created. If left empty, the name of
            the input table will be used.
        </option>
		<option name="Write column header">
			If checked, the column names are written out in the first
			row of the spreadsheet.
		</option>
		<option name="Write row ID">
			If checked, the row IDs are added to the output, in the
			first column of the spreadsheet.
		</option>
        <option name="Evaluate Formulas on write">
            If checked, all formulas in the file will be evaluated after the sheet has been written. This is useful
            if other sheets in the file refer to the data just written and their content needs updating. 
        </option>
		<option name="Missing Value Pattern">
			Enter a pattern that is set for missing data values. If not
			specified, the corresponding data cell of the spreadsheet
			stays empty.
		</option>
		<option name="Autosize columns">
			Fits the columns width to the content.
		</option>
		<option name="Portrait/Landscape">
			Sets the print format to portrait or landscape.
		</option>
		<option name="Paper size">
			Sets the paper size in the print setup.
		</option>
        <option name="Exclude/Include columns">
            Select the columns that will be written in the XLS/XLSX file. If the
            columns in the input table should change, they will automatically be
            excluded.
        </option>
