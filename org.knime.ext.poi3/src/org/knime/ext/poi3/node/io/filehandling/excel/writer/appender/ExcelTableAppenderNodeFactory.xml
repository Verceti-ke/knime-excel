    <name>Excel Sheet Appender (Labs)</name>
    <shortDescription> Writes data tables to an existing excel file. 
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            <p> This node writes the input data table into a spreadsheet of an already existing excel file.
                <br/>
                Adding additional sheet input ports allows to write multiple spreadsheets to the same file. 
            </p>
            <p>The node supports two formats chosen by file extension:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    .xls format: This is the file format which was used by default up until Excel 2003. The maximum
                    number of columns held by a spreadsheet of this format is 256. If the input data table has more than
                    65536 rows, it is split into multiple spreadsheets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    .xlsx format: The Office Open XML format is the file format used by default from Excel 2007 onwards.
                    The maximum number of columns held by a spreadsheet of this format is 16384. If the input data table
                    has more than 1048576 rows, it is split into multiple spreadsheets.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
	        <p>This nodes does not support writing in the 'xlsm' format.</p>
            <p>Specifying a remote URL as the destination location will force the node to overwrite this file as it is 
            not possible to determine whether this location already exists. If no extension is specified, the
            file will be written in the .xlsx format.</p>
        </intro>
        <option name="Read from">
				Select a file system which stores the data you want to read. There are
				four default file system options to choose from:
				<br />
				<ul>
	                <li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a file from your
	                    local system.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to read from a mountpoint.
	                	When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
	                	Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled in this case).
	                	Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
	                	A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
	                	You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
						relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area.
	                When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the three options to use.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime:// protocol). 
	                    When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and read timeout in milliseconds.
	                    Browsing is disabled for this option.
	                </li>
				</ul>
				To read from other file systems, click on <b>...</b> in the bottom left corner of the node icon followed by <i>Add File System Connection port</i>.
	            Afterwards, connect the desired file system connector node to the newly added input port.
	            The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
	            It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you have to (re)execute the connector node first.
				Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file system is provided via the input port.
			</option>
		<option name="File/URL">
			Enter a URL when reading from <i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>, otherwise enter a path to a file. The
			required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
			File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
	        File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, the node
	        description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
			You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down list, or select a location
			from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog. Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
			<ul>
				<li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i>Browsing is never enabled.</li>
				<li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
					Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.</li>
				<li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
					Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
					(Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.
				</li>
				</ul>
		</option>
		<option name="Create missing folders">Select if the folders of the selected output location should be 
			created if they do not already exist. If this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does
			not exist.
		</option>
		<option name="If exists">
			Specify the behavior of the node in case the output file already exists.
			<ul>
				<li><i>Overwrite:</i> Will replace any existing file.
				</li>
				<li><i>Fail:</i> Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent unintentional overwrite).
				</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
        <option name="Sheet name"> 
        	Name of the spreadsheets that will be created.
        </option>
		<option name="Abort if sheet already exists">
			Aborts the execution if a sheet with the given file name already exists, otherwise the sheet will be 
			replaced.
		</option>
        <option name="Write row key">
        	If checked, the row IDs are added to the output, in the first column of the spreadsheet.
        </option>
        <option name="Write column headers"> 
        	If checked, the column names are written out in the first row of the spreadsheet.
        </option>
        <option name="Replaces missing values by"> 
        	If selected missing values will be replaced by the specified value, otherwise a blank cell is being created.
        </option>
        <option name="Autosize columns">
        	Fits each column's width to its content.
        </option>
        <option name="Evaluate formulas">
        	If checked, all formulas in the file will be evaluated after the sheet has been written. This is useful if 
        	other sheets in the file refer to the data just written and their content needs updating.
        </option>
        <option name="Portrait/Landscape">
        	Sets the print format to portrait or landscape.
        </option>
        <option name="Paper size">
        	Sets the paper size in the print setup.
        </option>
